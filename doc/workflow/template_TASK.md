# The purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the problem and the solution to an AI that then can do the changes. 

# Instructions

* Implement one task at a time  
* Follow the code standard. Read the file README.md in the project root and follow its links to understand the project, the stack, code standard and how testing is to be done.  
* Explain your approach for each task  
* When you are done with a task   
  * run below commands to verify that things still work  
    * mvn clean install \-DskipTests  
    * mvn test  
  * Fill out the *Task Summary (to be completed by AI)* for the task you just completed  
    * Include major changes made and files affected  
    * Document key decisions and their rationale  
    * Note any challenges encountered and how they were resolved  
    * Highlight any items that might affect future tasks  
  * Fill out *Current Implementation Status (to be completed by AI)* and add which tasks have been completed. Simply add a row with *Task X done*.   
* Let me know when you've completed a task so I can verify it before moving to the next one
