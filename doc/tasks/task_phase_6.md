# Phase 6 - Project Finalization

# Current Implementation Status (to be completed by AI)

# Tasks

## Phase 6 - Task 1 - Update README with Usage Examples
Update the main README.md file to include basic usage documentation for the completed data generation system.

### Description
Add a simple usage section to the README explaining the purpose, generated files, and how to run the data generator.

### Content to Add
- Brief purpose statement
- List of 5 generated files with descriptions
- Basic usage example showing how to generate data
- Simple main method for command-line execution

### Deliverables
- Updated README.md with usage section
- Create Main.kt with main method for easy data generation execution

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Add "Usage" section to README.md
2. Explain purpose: generates mock data for WiseCrowd platform
3. List all 5 generated files (asset_data.txt, price_series.txt, users.txt, transactions.txt, user_holdings.txt) with brief descriptions
4. Show basic code example of how to generate data
5. Create Main.kt with main method for command-line execution
6. Include instructions for running via Maven, Kotlin, or IDE
7. Keep existing content (code standards links, project description links)
8. Simple and concise - no advanced scenarios or troubleshooting

### Task Summary (to be completed by AI)

## Phase 6 - Task 2 - Archive Task Documentation and Create Streamlined AI Documentation
Archive verbose task documentation and create concise documentation optimized for AI assistant interactions.

### Description
The current task documentation (task_overview.md, task_phase_*.md) is verbose and token-heavy for future AI interactions. Archive these files and create streamlined documentation that enables efficient AI assistant discussions and AI agent implementations.

### Current State
- Verbose task documentation across multiple files (~2000+ lines)
- High token consumption for AI reading
- Detailed implementation history mixed with current state
- Time-consuming for AIs to process

### Target State
- Task files archived to preserve project history
- Concise documentation optimized for AI consumption (~500 lines total)
- Clear architecture overview and development patterns
- Efficient AI onboarding for future development

### Deliverables

#### 1. Archive Task Documentation
- Create `doc/archive/tasks/` directory
- Move all task_*.md files to archive
- Remove any references to archived files

#### 2. Create Streamlined Documentation

**`doc/project_description/architecture_summary.md`**
- Pattern: Feature-based modular monolith
- Key components: Data generators, orchestration, file I/O
- Data flow: Config → Generators → Files (5 output files)
- Error handling: Centralized approach
- Logging: ILog interface with step-by-step progress

**`doc/project_description/api_reference.md`**
- Key interfaces (IDataGenerator, IDataSaver, ILog)
- Main entry points (WiseCrowdDataOrchestrator)
- Configuration options (DataGenerationConfig, IOutputDirectory)

**`doc/project_description/package_structure.md`**
- Package organization and responsibilities
- Dependencies between packages

### Content Guidelines
- Focus on current state, not implementation history
- Include practical examples and usage patterns
- Optimize for quick AI comprehension
- **Maximum 500 lines total across all new documentation**
- Use clear headings and bullet points for scannability

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All task documentation archived (not deleted)
2. New documentation covers all essential architecture knowledge
3. AI can understand project structure from new docs in <2 minutes
4. Documentation enables efficient problem-solving discussions
5. Clear guidance for implementing new features
6. **Maximum 500 lines total across all new documentation files**
7. All references to archived files removed from project
