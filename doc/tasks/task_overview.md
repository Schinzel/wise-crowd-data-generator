# Instructions & Workflow description

# The purpose
The purpose of this section is to provide instructions and explain the workflow for an AI.

# Instructions

* Implement one task at a time
* Follow the code standard. Read the file README.md in the project root and follow its links to understand the
project, the stack, code standard and how testing is to be done.
* All tasks must follow project standards, use defensive programming principles, and include comprehensive
unit tests unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## When you are done with a task
* Run below commands to verify that things work
  * mvn ktlint:format
  * mvn ktlint:check
  * mvn compile
  * mvn test
* Fill out the *Task Summary (to be completed by AI)* for the task you just completed
  * Be concise and to the point
  * Include major changes made and files affected
  * Document key decisions and their rationale
  * Highlight any items that might affect future tasks
* Fill out *Current Implementation Status (to be completed by AI)* and add which tasks have been completed.
  * Simply add a row with *Task X done - Name of task - YYYY-MM-DD*.
* Let me know when you've completed a task so I can verify it before moving to the next one

## When you are done with a phase
* Fill out *Current Phase Status (to be completed by AI)*
  * Add a date (format YYYY-MM-DD) when the phase was done
