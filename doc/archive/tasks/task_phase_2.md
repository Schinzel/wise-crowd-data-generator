# Tasks

## Phase 2 - Task 1 - Update FileNameEnum
Update the existing FileNameEnum to include user_holdings.txt file name.

### Description
Add the missing USER_HOLDINGS entry to FileNameEnum to support the complete set of 5 output files as specified in design.md.

### Deliverables
- Updated FileNameEnum with USER_HOLDINGS entry
- Updated unit tests to cover the new enum entry

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Add USER_HOLDINGS("user_holdings.txt") to FileNameEnum
2. Maintain existing entries unchanged
3. Update corresponding unit tests
4. Verify all tests still pass

### Task Summary (to be completed by AI)
**Completed**: Added USER_HOLDINGS entry to FileNameEnum and created comprehensive unit tests.

**Files Modified**: 
- `FileNameEnum.kt` - Added USER_HOLDINGS("user_holdings.txt") enum entry
- `FileNameEnumTest.kt` - Created new test class with 9 test methods

**Key Changes**: 
- Completed the required 5th output file name for user holdings data
- Maintained existing enum structure and naming conventions
- Added defensive tests for enum validation and uniqueness

**Tests**: All 219 tests pass, including 9 new FileNameEnum tests

## Phase 2 - Task 2 - Customer Countries Collection
Create CustomerCountriesCollection to support realistic Nordic customer distribution for banking simulation.

### Description
Implement a data collection that represents the Nordic countries where bank customers are located. This provides realistic customer demographics for the Swedish bank simulation, following the same patterns as other collection classes.

### Collection Data (from design.md)
| ID | Name | Country Code | Description | Distribution (%) |
|----|------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1  | Sweden | SE | Home market with largest customer base | 60 |
| 2  | Norway | NO | Oil wealth economy with active investors | 15 |
| 3  | Denmark | DK | Strong financial sector and banking ties | 12 |
| 4  | Finland | FI | Tech-savvy market with Nordic connections | 8 |
| 5  | Iceland | IS | Small but wealthy per capita customer base | 5 |

### Deliverables
- CustomerCountry data class
- CustomerCountriesCollection class with predefined Nordic data
- Integration with existing collection patterns

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Follow existing collection patterns (similar to CurrencyCollection and ActivityLevelCollection)
2. Place in `data_collections/customer_country/` package
3. CustomerCountry data class with id, name, countryCode, description, distributionPercentage
4. CustomerCountriesCollection with filtering and lookup methods:
   - getAll() method
   - getByDistribution() method for weighted selection
   - getByCountryCode() method for lookup
5. Predefined Nordic countries data matching design.md table

### Task Summary (to be completed by AI)
**Completed**: Created CustomerCountriesCollection with Nordic customer distribution for banking simulation.

**Files Created**: 
- `CustomerCountry.kt` - Data class with id, name, countryCode, description, distributionPercentage
- `CustomerCountriesCollection.kt` - Collection class with filtering and lookup methods
- `CustomerCountryTest.kt` - 19 comprehensive unit tests
- `CustomerCountriesCollectionTest.kt` - 18 comprehensive unit tests

**Key Features**: 
- Follows existing collection patterns (similar to CurrencyCollection)
- Contains predefined Nordic countries data (Sweden 60%, Norway 15%, Denmark 12%, Finland 8%, Iceland 5%)
- Includes getAll(), getByDistribution(), and getByCountryCode() methods
- Full defensive programming with input validation

**Tests**: All 256 tests pass, including 37 new customer country tests
