# Project Overview

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to generate data for the WiseCrowd platform. 

## Business Value
* by generating large data sets we can test the performance for different scenarios
* we can derive asset allocation indices and verify that these are as we expect


## Key Features
The result of running the code be the files:
- asset_data.txt
- users.txt
- price_series.txt
- transactions.txt
These files can be used by the WiseCrowd platform to generate asset allocation indices.

By changing parameters we can get very large data sets to test performance. 
We can create long bear or bull markets in the generated data to see how this affects the asset allocation indices. 
We can see how aggressive or cautious investors affects the asset allocation indices

## Target Users
Developers of the WiseCrowd platform.

## Project Scope
The project will generate a set of text files.
