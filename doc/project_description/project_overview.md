# Project Overview

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to generate mocked data for the WiseCrowd platform. 

By changing parameters we can get very large data sets to test performance.
We can create long bear or bull markets in the generated data to see how this affects the asset allocation indices.
We can see how aggressive or cautious investors affects the asset allocation indices

## User story
As a developer   
I want a tool that can generate mocked data   
So that I can develop the WiseCrowd platform using data of different sizes and configurations

## Business values
By generating large data sets we can test the performance (time, RAM, CPU) for different scenarios.  
We can derive asset allocation indices and verify that these are as we expect.

## Target Users
Developers of the WiseCrowd platform.

## Project output
The result of running the code be the files:
- asset_data.txt
- users.txt
- price_series.txt
- transactions.txt
- user_holdings.txt

These files can be used by the WiseCrowd platform to generate asset allocation indices.
