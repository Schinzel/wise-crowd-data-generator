# Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation progress of the WiseCrowd Data Generator project as of May 2025. The project generates mocked data for developing and testing the WiseCrowd investment platform.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
The foundational components have been successfully implemented, providing the core infrastructure for data generation.

### Core Infrastructure
- **FileNameEnum**: Centralized storage of output file names (asset_data.txt, users.txt, price_series.txt, transactions.txt)
- **FileDataSaver**: Implementation of IDataSaver for writing data to text files with proper formatting:
  - Tab-delimited columns (\t)
  - Newline-delimited rows (\n) 
  - String qualifiers (###)
  - Defensive programming with error handling
  - Automatic directory creation

### Data Collections Package
All data collection classes are organized under `com.wisecrowd.data_generator.data_collections` with consistent patterns:

#### Market Trends (`market_trend/`)
- **MarketTrend**: Represents historical market trends with date ranges, types, and strength
- **MarketTrendCollection**: Manages collection of market trends with filtering capabilities
- Contains predefined Swedish/Nordic market trends from 1990-2025

#### Asset Classes (`asset_class/`)
- **AssetClass**: Represents investment asset classes with volatility and prevalence data
- **AssetClassCollection**: Collection management with filtering by volatility and prevalence
- Contains 8 predefined asset classes (Nordic stocks, bonds, commodities, etc.)

#### Currencies (`currency/`)
- **Currency**: Represents currencies with distribution percentages and SEK conversion rates
- **CurrencyCollection**: Collection management with filtering and lookup capabilities
- Contains 8 major currencies (SEK, EUR, USD, NOK, DKK, GBP, JPY, CHF)

#### Investor Profiles (`investor_profile/`)
- **InvestorProfile**: Represents different investment strategies and risk tolerances
- **InvestorProfileCollection**: Collection management with distribution-based filtering
- Contains 5 profiles: Conservative (25%), Balanced (40%), Aggressive (20%), Income (10%), Trend (5%)

#### Activity Levels (`activity_level/`)
- **ActivityLevel**: Represents user trading activity patterns
- **ActivityLevelCollection**: Collection management with distribution-based operations
- Contains 5 levels: Inactive (22%), Low (39%), Moderate (28%), Active (9%), Hyperactive (2%)

## Output Structure
The system generates UTF-8 encoded text files in a timestamped directory on the user's desktop:
```
~/Desktop/wise_crowd_data_2025_09_30_14_45/
├── asset_data.txt
├── users.txt
├── price_series.txt
└── transactions.txt
```

## Phase 2: Data Generators (Next)
The foundation is complete and ready for implementing the actual data generators:
- AssetDataGenerator (using AssetClassCollection)
- UserDataGenerator (using InvestorProfileCollection and ActivityLevelCollection)
- PriceSeriesDataGenerator (using MarketTrendCollection)
- TransactionDataGenerator (using CurrencyCollection and generated data)

## Key Implementation Decisions

### Package Organization
- Moved all data classes under `data_collections` package for better organization
- Consistent naming patterns across all collection classes
- Clear separation between data models and business logic

### Data Distribution Strategy
- Used percentage-based distribution for realistic data generation
- Predefined collections with business-relevant data for Swedish/Nordic markets
- Configurable distributions through collection filtering methods

### Error Handling Philosophy
- Fail-fast approach with IllegalArgumentException for invalid states
- Comprehensive error collection in FileDataSaver for batch operations
- Defensive validation at object creation time

This foundation provides a robust, well-tested platform for implementing the data generation logic in Phase 2.
